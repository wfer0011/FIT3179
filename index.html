    <h1>Global Plastic pollution</h1>
<div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <div class="textbox">Humans taking over the Earth's natural systems is impacting air and water quality around the world.
        Pollution is a global problem.It is now everywhere, from the soil we walk on to the air we breath.
        Plastic pollution is now one of the most dangerous issues the earth is facing right now.
        Plastic is ubiquitous in our everyday lives.
        Some plastics we can reuse or recycle—and many play important roles in areas like medicine and public safety—but other items such as straws,
        cups bottles are designed for only one use. In fact, more than 40 percent of plastic is used only once before it is thrown away,
        where it lingers in the environment for a long, long time. 
        It often breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, called microplastics, which can be ingested by both animals and people.
        At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year,
        and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.
        Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and death.</div>

    <div class="textbox">The production of plastic has been rapidly increasing during the last few decades.
        The world now produces more than 380 million tonnes of plastic every year.
        Global cumulative production of plastics since 1950 is forecast to grow to 34 billion tons by 2050.
